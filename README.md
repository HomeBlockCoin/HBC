Proof of work defined
----------------------
X11 algorithm (PoW)


SECURITY

X11 algorithm uses eleven hashing functions from the Blake algorithm to the Keccak algorithm making it very secure which really is needed for coins that do so well for CPU’s

EFFECTIVENESS

X11 Algorithm keeps miners temperature over 30% cooler, making your expensive machines less prone to overheating because don’t require as much processing power in order to mine the coins with this algorithm

POWER COST

X11 provides significantly lower electricity costs at the end of the month mining HomeBlock Coin. This makes to be a favorite in places where electricity costs are expensive


Proof of stake defined
Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many HomeBlock coins he or she holds. This means that the more HBC owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has, which results with bigger profit.

Advantages:

No electricity cost

No noise

Great ROI

Secured funds

Friendly interface
